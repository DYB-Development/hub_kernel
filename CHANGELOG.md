## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- `HubKernel::Ports`, which a hub extends to declare each port it needs with `port :name, as: :method`. The app fills the port with any callable, and calling the method returns that callable's answer.
- `HubKernel::UnwiredPortError`, raised when a hub calls a port the app left unfilled, with a message naming the hub and the port.
